# Severe Weather Database
This is a living copy of the NOAA Severe Weather Database that I utilize for the creation of annual severe weather files.
Additionally, this database serves as my version to track changes to the database when errors are brought to my attention.
These data should not be considered official as official records are maintained by the [National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov).

At present, the data contained herein are simply that found on the [NOAA/NWS Storm Prediction Center's Warning Coordination Meteorologist's website](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm#data).
However, with time my hope is to combine this data with that from Dr. Fujita and Mr. Grazulis to extend the database farther back in time.
